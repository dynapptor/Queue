= Queue Library
:toc: left

== Overview

The Queue library provides a generic, circular queue implementation in C++ for Arduino and other embedded platforms. It is designed to store pointers to objects of any type, using a template-based approach. The queue operates in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner and is optimized for memory-constrained environments.

== Features

- **Generic Implementation**: Supports any data type via C++ templates.
- **Circular Buffer**: Efficiently reuses memory with a fixed-size queue.
- **Memory Management**: Handles pointers to objects, leaving object deallocation to the caller.
- **Thread Safety**: Not thread-safe by default; use with caution in multi-threaded environments.

== Installation

1. Download the library from the repository.
2. Extract the folder to your Arduino `libraries` directory.
3. Include the library in your sketch with `#include <Queue.h>`.

== Usage

See the `examples` directory for sample code. A basic example is provided in the `README.md` and `example.ino`.
